# üì¢ Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025 - exDQLM

## üöÄ About This Repository
This repository is dedicated to the **Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025** project aimed at updating and extending the **exDQLM** package for Bayesian Dynamic Quantile Regression. It will serve as a central hub for:
- GSoC proposal drafts and related documents
- Project development and implementation
- Code contributions and discussions
- Project website and documentation

## üéØ Project Goal: Enhancing exDQLM
The primary objective is to **expand and optimize exDQLM**, making it a more powerful, flexible, and scalable tool for Bayesian quantile regression. Key improvements include:
- **Static Quantile Regression** using **Variational Bayes (VB)**
- **Posterior Predictive Quantile Synthesis (PPQS)** for non-crossing quantile estimation
- **Efficient Bayesian inference** using **C++ (Rcpp)** for large datasets
- **Integration with the broader Bayesian R ecosystem**, ensuring compatibility with key packages

## üìå What is Google Summer of Code (GSoC)?
[Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global, **stipend-funded** program by Google that supports open-source development. Participants work on software projects under experienced mentors.

### **How GSoC Works**
1. Contributors submit project proposals to open-source organizations (e.g., the R Project).
2. Mentors guide contributors throughout the project.
3. Google provides stipends based on successful project completion.
